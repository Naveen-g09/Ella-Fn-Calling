# Open AI Function Calling

This project integrates the OpenAI API with function calling and various tools. In this particular part, we utilize the ChatGPT 3.5 model to respond to user inputs. If it's a normal query, the AI will generate a response. If it's a health-related issue, it will search through a database of doctors and refer a suitable one based on properties such as name, type of consultation, and specialty.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Naveen-g09/Open-Ai-Function-Calling.git`
2. Navigate into the cloned directory: `cd Open-Ai-Function-Calling`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.
5. That's it! 
6. In `index.ts`, provide your prompt.
7. Run `npm start` in the terminal.

Enjoy using the Open AI Function Calling integration!
